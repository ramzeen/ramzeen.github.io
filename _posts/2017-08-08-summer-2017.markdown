<p>Volleyball and soccer during weekdays and table tennis during weekends. Not bad from an exercising point of view. Yet I
am feeling lonely.</p>

<p>It is too bad that there aren't many Barnes and Noble stores in the city. The closure of the one at Citigroup Center las
t summer made me really sad.</p>

<p>I am done with the first season of The Tunnel on Amazon TV. The acting of the main characters was awesome. The show kind
 of petered out at the end though. I want to watch season 2.</p>
